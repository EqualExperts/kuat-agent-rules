# SEO Content

Guidance for findable, readable, and helpful marketing content.

---

**Prerequisites:** [Foundations content](../../../../foundations/content/README.md), [marketing content](./marketing-content.md).

---

## Principles

- **Findable** – Use language people search for; structure and meta data support discovery.
- **Readable** – Clear headings, short paragraphs, plain language (see [writing style](../../../../foundations/content/writing-style.md)).
- **Helpful** – Content should answer a real question or need. Don't optimise for search at the expense of the reader.

## Page Titles and Meta Descriptions

- **Title:** Clear, descriptive, and relevant to the page. Include key terms where natural. Keep within typical display length (e.g. ~50–60 characters) for important pages.
- **Meta description:** Summarise the page and encourage a click. Match the page content; avoid generic or duplicate copy.

---

## Headings

- Use a logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3). One H1 per page.
- Make headings descriptive so they work for both scanning and search. Use key phrases where they fit naturally; don't stuff keywords.

---

## Links

- Use descriptive link text that states the destination or topic (good for accessibility and context).
- Internal links help users and crawlers discover related content.
