## Voice and Format

- Use [foundations writing style](../../../../foundations/content/writing-style.md): active voice, plain language, "you" and "we".
- Keep paragraphs short (3–4 sentences). Use lists and headings so content is scannable.
- Support claims with evidence and examples. Avoid generic or unsupported statements.
- Typical length: enough to cover the topic clearly; avoid padding. For many posts, a few hundred to ~1,500 words works well.
