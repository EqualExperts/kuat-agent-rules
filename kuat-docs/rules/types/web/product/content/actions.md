# Actions (Buttons and Links)

Guidance for button labels and link text in product interfaces.

---

## Buttons

**Do:**
- Use verb-driven labels
- Be specific about what happens
- Keep labels short (1–3 words ideal)
- Use sentence case

**Don't:**
- Use vague labels like "OK" or "Submit"
- Make labels overly long
- Use ALL CAPS
- Include instructions in button labels

**Good examples:**
- [Save and close]
- [Delete expense]
- [Send invoice now]
- [Connect bank]

**Bad examples:**
- [OK] (ambiguous)
- [SUBMIT FORM NOW] (shouty, vague)
- [Click here to continue] (generic)

---

## Links

- Use descriptive link text that states the destination or action
- Avoid "click here", "read more", or "learn more" without context
- See [foundations content formatting](../../../../foundations/content/formatting.md) for link guidelines
