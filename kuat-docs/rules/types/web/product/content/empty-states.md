# Empty States

How to write copy when there's no data or content to show yet.

---

## Principles

**Do:**
- Explain why the state is empty
- Provide a clear next action
- Use a positive, encouraging tone

**Don't:**
- Leave the user guessing
- Use negative or blaming language
- Offer multiple competing actions without a clear primary one

## Example

```
No invoices yet

Create your first invoice to get paid faster.
It takes less than 2 minutes.

[Create invoice]
```
