# Slides Rules

Guidelines for creating Equal Experts presentation decks and slides.

---

**Status:** Placeholder (skeleton). Load only when the task is explicitly slides/presentations; otherwise prefer [general rules](../../general/). For which general files to load with slides, see [LOADING.md](../../LOADING.md) (task: slides).

**Prerequisites:** Load [general rules](../../general/) first (at least brand, logo, colours, typography, content for slides).

---

## Overview

These rules govern the creation of presentation slides for Equal Experts, including pitch decks, client presentations, internal presentations, and conference talks.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity first** - Every slide should have one clear message
2. **Visual hierarchy** - Guide the viewer's eye through the content
3. **Brand consistency** - Use Equal Experts brand colors, fonts, and logo
4. **Accessibility** - Ensure sufficient contrast and readability

---

## Logo Placement

- Place logo in header or footer area
- Use appropriate variant for slide background
- Minimum size: 100px width
- See [general/logo.md](../../general/logo.md) for variant selection

---

## Typography

- Use Lexend for all text
- Minimum font size: 18px for body text, 14px for footnotes
- See [general/typography.md](../../general/typography.md) for type scale

---

## Colors

- Use brand color palette
- Ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds
- See [general/colours.md](../../general/colours.md) for palette

---

## Content Guidelines

- Follow [general/content.md](../../general/content.md) for writing style
- One idea per slide
- Use bullet points sparingly
- Include speaker notes for complex slides

---

Further guidance (templates, animation, master slides, export formats) to be added as needed.
