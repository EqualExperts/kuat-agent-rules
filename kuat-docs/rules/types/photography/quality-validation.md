# Photography — Quality, Accessibility & Validation

Technical quality standards, accessibility requirements for images, and the pre-publish validation checklist.

**See also:** [foundations/accessibility.md](../../foundations/accessibility.md) for full accessibility guidance. [principles.md](./principles.md), [diversity-inclusion.md](./diversity-inclusion.md), [style-and-sources.md](./style-and-sources.md).

## 1. Technical quality standards

All images used in EE content must meet these minimum quality standards:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Resolution** | High enough for intended output (web minimum 72dpi, print minimum 300dpi) |
| **Sharpness** | No motion blur, camera shake, or focus errors on the primary subject |
| **Exposure** | Correctly exposed — not over-exposed (blown highlights) or under-exposed (lost shadow detail) |
| **Cropping** | Subject(s) appropriately framed — no awkward crops of heads, hands, or significant elements |
| **Aspect ratio** | Match the intended layout — avoid stretching or squashing images |

## 2. Accessibility requirements

All images used in content must comply with accessibility standards.

- **REQUIRED:** Every non-decorative image must have descriptive alt text.  
- **REQUIRED:** Alt text should describe the content and context of the image, not just label it (e.g. "Two engineers reviewing code on a laptop in an open-plan office" not "photo of people").  
- **REQUIRED:** Decorative images (purely visual, no informational value) should use `alt=""` so they are skipped by screen readers.  
- **DON'T:** Rely solely on an image to convey critical information — always support with text.  

> See the EE Accessibility Best Practices guide for full guidance on writing alt text.

## 3. Validation checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing any image before publishing or submitting for approval.

### Source & rights

- [ ] Image sourced from EE People Library, EE Stock Library, or marketing-approved source  
- [ ] Copyright is cleared for the intended use  
- [ ] No unapproved third-party images  

### Style compliance

- [ ] Monochrome treatment applied (unless exception applies)  
- [ ] Image is not overly staged or contrived  
- [ ] No holograms, AR overlays, or fictional technology  
- [ ] Image does not rely on colour or text to convey meaning  
- [ ] No low-quality (blurry, distorted, over-exposed) images  

### Content

- [ ] Image supports the surrounding content — not generic filler  
- [ ] Technology shown is realistic and current  
- [ ] Location imagery is accurate and recent  

### Diversity & inclusion

- [ ] Image avoids reinforcing a demographic default for the role or activity shown  
- [ ] People of different ethnicities are represented across the full content set  
- [ ] People of different ages are represented across the full content set  
- [ ] Women and non-binary people appear in technical and leadership contexts, not only facilitation roles  
- [ ] Diversity in the image feels authentic and natural, not staged for representation purposes  
- [ ] Viewed as a full set, all images in this piece represent a realistic cross-section of people  
- [ ] Single-person images do not reinforce a stereotype about the role or activity depicted  

### Accessibility

- [ ] Alt text is present and descriptive  
- [ ] Alt text reflects the content and context, not just a label (e.g. "Engineer reviewing a pull request on a laptop" not "person at computer")  
- [ ] Decorative images marked with `alt=""`

## 4. Quick reference — Do and Don't

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Use monochrome for all standard contexts | Use colour images outside permitted exceptions |
| Use EE People Library as first choice | Source images without marketing approval |
| Show authentic moments at work | Use posed, staged, or contrived scenarios |
| Feature people of different ages, genders, ethnicities, and roles | Default to a narrow demographic profile |
| Show women and non-binary people in technical and leadership roles | Reserve facilitation/support roles for women by default |
| Assess diversity across the full set of images, not individually | Approve each image in isolation and ignore cumulative effect |
| Ensure diverse people appear throughout content naturally | Place a single diverse person prominently to satisfy representation |
| Use realistic technology in images | Use holograms, AR, or fictional devices |
| Use physical objects to represent abstract concepts | Use heavily typographic or colourful concept art |
| Write descriptive, contextual alt text | Publish images without alt text |
| Check images are sharp, well-exposed, and high resolution | Use blurry, distorted, or over-exposed images |
