## 1. Monochrome (black and white) treatment

All photography used in Equal Experts branded contexts must be rendered in **monochrome (black and white)** unless a specific exception applies.

### 1.1 When monochrome is required

|---------|---------------------|
| Internal documents and reports | ✅ Yes |
| Internal presentations | ✅ Yes |
| External marketing and sales materials | ✅ Yes |
| Websites and internal sites | ✅ Yes |
| Social media | ✅ Yes |

### 1.2 Exceptions — colour is permitted

| Exception | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Logos | Must remain in brand colour for recognition |
| Graphics and diagrams | Must follow the EE colour palette |
| Video content | See video brand guidelines |
| Brand collaborations | Follow agreed style with partner brand |

## 2. Image source priority

Always follow this priority order when selecting imagery:

1. **EE People Library** — real network members, employees, consultants, alumni (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e6o_JFsckfuVJ71CnMnRyAj-V2q-A3P1?usp=drive_link)
2. **Approved EE Stock Library** — pre-cleared images matching brand style (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TfBvmuQrtgi94GQTDYaAvbyGbCVPzD8J)
3. **New stock sourced via the Marketing team** — with correct copyright clearance  

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Use the EE People image library as the first stop for all people imagery | Source and use stock images independently without marketing approval |
| Use the approved stock library for industry, location, and technology concepts | Use images from unapproved sources, personal libraries, or generic image searches |

> If you cannot find a suitable image in either library, contact the marketing team via Slack **#ask-marketing**.

## 3. EE People photography

Images featuring members of the Equal Experts network take priority over all other imagery.

### 3.1 What qualifies as EE People imagery

- Current employees  
- Active consultants  
- Alumni who have provided consent  

### 3.2 Acceptable subject matter

- People working individually (at laptops, writing, reviewing documents)  
- Small group collaboration (whiteboard sessions, standups, pair working)  
- Social and event contexts (conferences, off-sites, team gatherings)  
- A mix of activities, emotions, and workplace interactions  

### 3.3 Verification checklist for EE People imagery

- [ ] Image is sourced from the official EE People image library  
- [ ] Subject(s) have provided consent (handled centrally by marketing)  
- [ ] Image has been converted to monochrome (unless an exception applies)  
- [ ] Image reflects authentic moment — not overly staged  
- [ ] Diversity of representation is considered

## 4. Stock photography

Use stock photography when EE people imagery doesn't cover the required use case — e.g. industry-specific message or concept illustration.

### 4.1 Approved stock use cases

| Use case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Industry context** | A retail transaction to illustrate a retail engagement |
| **Location** | A cityscape of Sydney for an Australia-based case study |
| **Technology in use** | A person using a laptop, tablet, or phone — showing realistic UI |
| **Technology concept** | A close-up of a microchip or circuit board — minimal, clean |
| **Abstract concepts** | A padlock and credit card to represent security or fraud |
| **Natural/work settings** | Hands sketching wireframes, someone taking notes |

### 4.2 Stock photography — approved characteristics

- **Natural and genuine:** Believable, unstaged scenarios; natural expressions and body language; environments that feel real.  
- **Industry settings:** Recognisable real-world activities; settings that align with the content topic.  
- **Accurate locations:** Recent images; clearly identifiable landmarks or cityscapes when location matters.  
- **Technology in use:** Realistic devices and software; genuine interaction (not posed "pretend typing"); screens showing plausible content.  
- **Abstract concepts as real objects:** Use physical objects to represent concepts (e.g. padlock = security); avoid digitally fabricated metaphors.  

### 4.3 Stock photography — prohibited content

| ❌ Prohibited | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Overly staged people shots | Feels fake — e.g. group high-fives, team huddles, posed "collaboration" |
| Heavily edited/unrealistic technology | Holograms, augmented reality overlays, fictional devices |
| Images reliant on colour or text for meaning | Won't work in monochrome — e.g. colourful AI concept art with floating text |
| Low-quality images | Blurry, distorted, or over-exposed — undermines brand credibility |
| **AI-generated imagery** | Not approved for use — authenticity and copyright are unverifiable |
