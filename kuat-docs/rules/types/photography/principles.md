# Photography — Core Principles

Equal Experts photography style is **professional, people-focused and authentic**. These principles apply to all content and marketing materials: documents, presentations, websites, social media, videos, blogs, case studies, and print.

**Prerequisites:** Load [foundations](../../foundations/) first (at least [brand](../../foundations/brand.md); see [LOADING.md](../../LOADING.md) for task: photography).

## 1. Authenticity first

All photography must feel genuine and relatable. Images should capture real moments of people at work, collaborating, or socialising — not posed or performative scenarios.

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Use candid or near-candid shots that capture natural emotion and interaction | Use images of people posing directly at the camera with forced smiles |
| Show real work environments — desks, whiteboards, post-it notes, laptops in use | Use overly staged team scenarios (e.g. group high-fives, hands in a circle, hands cupping a plant) |

## 2. People-focused

Images should centre human presence wherever possible. Prioritise photos that show people engaged in meaningful activity.

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Show range of emotion — concentration, laughter, discussion, problem-solving | Use imagery where people are incidental or decorative |
| Feature people in context: at laptops, at whiteboards, in meetings, at events | — |

## 3. Diversity and representation

Photography must represent a genuinely diverse range of people across all content. Diversity is not a secondary consideration — it is a **core quality criterion**. An image that is technically well-shot but fails to represent the breadth of the EE network and the world it works in does not meet our standard.

- **REQUIRED:** Feature people of different ages, genders, and ethnicities.
- **REQUIRED:** Represent different roles — not just leadership or technical roles.
- **DON'T:** Default to images that over-represent any single demographic.
- **DON'T:** Use diversity as tokenism — a single non-white face in an otherwise homogeneous image does not satisfy this principle.
