# Photography — Diversity & Inclusion

Equal Experts is a network of people from many backgrounds, cultures, disciplines, and life experiences. Our photography must reflect that reality. When reviewing or selecting any image featuring people, evaluate each criterion deliberately, not by assumption.

**See also:** [principles.md](./principles.md) (core principles), [quality-validation.md](./quality-validation.md) (validation checklist).

## 1. Why this matters

Images that default to narrow demographic assumptions — consciously or not — undermine trust with our audience and misrepresent who we are. This section provides specific, checkable criteria for image selection and sets.

## 2. Demographic representation

### Age

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Include people at different career stages — early, mid, and senior | Default to imagery that reads as a young workforce |
| Show older practitioners as active contributors, not only mentoring/management | Use imagery where older people are only observational or passive |

### Gender

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Show women and non-binary people in technical, leadership, and delivery roles | Default to male-presenting people for technical subjects (coding, architecture, engineering) |
| Ensure gender representation is balanced across a **collection** of images | Default to female-presenting people for facilitation, administration, or soft-skills subjects |

### Ethnicity and cultural background

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Actively seek images that represent people of different ethnic backgrounds | Use a single image of a person of colour to satisfy representation across a piece of content |
| Ensure non-white people appear **throughout** content — not only in dedicated diversity moments | Associate specific ethnicities with specific roles or seniority (e.g. only white people in leadership shots) |

### Disability and visible difference

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Include images of people with visible disabilities where appropriate and available | Exclude or avoid people with visible disabilities when selecting images |
| Treat disability as a normal part of working life — not as a subject requiring special framing | Over-focus on disability as the defining element unless that is the specific subject matter |

## 3. Role and context representation

The roles and contexts in which people are shown carry meaning. Consistently showing the same type of person in the same type of role reinforces stereotypes.

| Context | ✅ Ensure variety includes | ❌ Avoid defaulting to |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Technical work (coding, architecture) | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly young white or Asian men |
| Leadership / presenting | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly white men |
| Facilitation / workshops | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly women |
| Support / administrative | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly women or junior-presenting people |
| Senior / experienced practitioners | Older people, all backgrounds | Only younger people |

## 4. Evaluating a set of images

Diversity must be assessed at the level of the **full set of images** used in a piece of content or campaign — not image by image in isolation.

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Review all images together before publishing to check overall representation | Approve each image individually and ignore the cumulative effect |
| If a single image shows one person, consider how that person's characteristics interact with the rest of the content | Use the same demographic profile repeatedly across a page or document just because each image technically passed review |

**Example — passing individually, failing collectively:**  
A case study page uses five images. Each image passes the individual quality check. But all five show white men working alone. This set **fails** the diversity standard even though no single image was flagged.

## 5. Authentic inclusion vs performative diversity

**Authentic inclusion looks like:**
- A diverse group captured doing real work together, where diversity is incidental to the shot
- A senior practitioner of any background shown in a position of authority naturally
- Mixed groups in candid collaboration where the focus is the work, not the demographic mix

**Performative diversity looks like:**
- A carefully arranged group photo with one person of each demographic type, all smiling at camera
- A person of colour or woman placed visibly in the foreground of an otherwise homogeneous image
- Stock imagery where diversity feels like a deliberate product feature rather than a natural reality

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|----------|
| Choose images where diverse people appear as a natural consequence of capturing real work | Select images where diversity appears to be the *purpose* of the image rather than a reflection of it |

## 6. Diversity checklist for image selection

Use these checks for any image featuring people, in addition to the general [validation checklist](./quality-validation.md#validation-checklist).

- [ ] Does this image avoid reinforcing a demographic default for the role or activity shown?
- [ ] Are people of different ethnicities represented across the full content set?
- [ ] Are people of different ages represented across the full content set?
- [ ] Are women and non-binary people shown in technical and leadership contexts, not only in facilitation roles?
- [ ] Is the diversity in the image authentic and natural, rather than clearly staged for representation purposes?
- [ ] Viewed alongside all other images in this piece of content, does the set as a whole represent a realistic cross-section of people?
- [ ] If only one person is shown, does the choice of that person avoid reinforcing a stereotype about the role or activity?
