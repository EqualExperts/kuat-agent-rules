# Charts & Data Visualization Rules

Guidelines for Equal Experts charts and data visualization.

---

**Status:** Placeholder (skeleton). Load only when the task is explicitly charts/data visualization; otherwise prefer [general rules](../../general/). For which general files to load with charts, see [LOADING.md](../../LOADING.md) (task: charts_data). This README includes minimal actionable guidance (colour, type, chart types).

**Prerequisites:** Load [general rules](../../general/) first (at least colours, typography; see LOADING.md).

---

## Overview

These rules govern the creation of charts, graphs, and data visualizations in Equal Experts materials.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Accuracy** - Data must be represented accurately and honestly
2. **Clarity** - Charts should be easy to understand
3. **Accessibility** - Don't rely on color alone, use labels and patterns
4. **Simplicity** - Remove unnecessary chart elements (chartjunk)

---

## Chart Colors

Use the brand color palette for data visualization:

| Color | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| EE Blue | Primary data series |
| Transform Teal | Secondary data series |
| Tech Blue | Tertiary data series |
| Equal Ember | Highlight/accent |
| Slate variations | Supporting data |

**Accessibility:** Use patterns or labels in addition to color for color-blind users.

## Chart Types

### Bar Charts
- Use for comparing categories
- Horizontal or vertical orientation
- Clear axis labels

### Line Charts
- Use for trends over time
- Clear data point markers
- Labeled axes

### Pie/Donut Charts
- Use sparingly (bar charts often clearer)
- Maximum 5-6 segments
- Direct labeling preferred

### Area Charts
- Use for cumulative data
- Clear legend
- Consider stacking carefully

---

## Typography in Charts

- Use Lexend font
- Axis labels: 12-14px minimum
- Chart titles: 16-18px, semibold
- Data labels: 11-12px minimum

---

Further guidance (templates, grid/axis styling, legend placement, export formats) to be added as needed.
