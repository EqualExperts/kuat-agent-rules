## Brand Values

### 1. Expertise Through Experience

We hire only experienced consultants. Our expertise comes from years of hands-on work, not certifications or titles.

### 2. Equality and Collaboration

Everyone is equal. We work alongside clients as partners, not vendors. No account managers, no hierarchy - just experts working together.

### 3. Honesty and Transparency

We tell clients what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. We're direct about risks, challenges, and realistic outcomes.

### 4. Pragmatism Over Perfection

We focus on delivering value, not following processes for their own sake. We choose practical solutions that work in the real world.
