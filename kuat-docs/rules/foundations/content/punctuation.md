# Punctuation

Guidance for commas, dashes, apostrophes, and other punctuation in Equal Experts content.

## Quick Reference

- **Commas:** Use to separate clauses and items in a list; avoid comma splices
- **Apostrophes:** Use for possessives and contractions; don't use for plurals
- **Dashes:** Use en dash for ranges (40–60); use em dash sparingly for a break in a sentence
- **Hyphens:** Use in compound modifiers before a noun (e.g. well-known); follow standard compound rules
- **Exclamation points:** Use rarely; one is enough

---

## Commas

- Use a comma before "and" or "or" in a list of three or more items (Oxford comma) for clarity when it avoids ambiguity
- Use commas to set off non-essential clauses
- Don't join two independent clauses with only a comma (use a full stop, semicolon, or conjunction)

---

## Apostrophes

- **Possessives:** Add 's for singular (team's, user's); add ' for plural already ending in s (users', teams')
- **Contractions:** Use for standard contractions (don't, it's, we're)
- **Plurals:** Do not use an apostrophe for plurals: "1990s" not "1990's"; "APIs" not "API's"

## Dashes and Hyphens

- **En dash (–):** Use for ranges (40–60%, March–May, 9–5). Use unspaced in British style.
- **Em dash (—):** Use sparingly for a strong break or aside. Prefer one em dash per sentence.
- **Hyphen (-):** Use in compound modifiers before a noun: "well-known result", "up-to-date report". Don't hyphenate after the noun when the modifier follows: "the result is well known".
- **Hyphen in compounds:** Follow standard usage (e.g. "email", "multi-factor", "read-only" as per common style)

## Colons and Semicolons

- **Colon:** Use to introduce a list or an explanation that follows from the main clause. One space after a colon.
- **Semicolon:** Use to link closely related independent clauses, or to separate list items that already contain commas. Use sparingly; often a full stop is clearer.

---

## Ellipses

- Use for omitted words in a quote (three dots: …)
- Avoid in UI or body copy to indicate "more" or trailing thought; rewrite so the sentence is complete

---

## Exclamation Points

- Use rarely; reserve for genuine emphasis or short, positive confirmation
- One exclamation point is enough; never use multiple (!!)

---

## Quotation Marks

- Use double quotation marks for direct speech and short quoted phrases
- Put full stops and commas inside the closing quote when they apply to the quoted matter; outside when they apply to the whole sentence (British style)
- For terms or "scare quotes", use sparingly
