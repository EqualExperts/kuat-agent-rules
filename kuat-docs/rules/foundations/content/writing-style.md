# Writing Style

Style and usage principles for Equal Experts content. Be clear, precise, and conversational.

---

## Quick Reference

**Do:**
- Use active voice
- Use everyday contractions (we're, it's, don't)
- Use simple verb tenses (present, past; avoid unnecessary future or perfect)
- Address the reader as "you"
- Prefer short sentences

**Don't:**
- Use passive voice when active is clearer
- Use formal or stiff phrasing
- Over-qualify with "in order to", "in the event that"
- Use jargon without explanation

---

## Active Voice

Prefer the subject doing the action. It's clearer and more direct.

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|--------|
| The team delivered the project on time | The project was delivered on time by the team |
| You can save your work here | Work can be saved here |
| We recommend testing first | It is recommended that testing be performed first |

Use passive only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant, or when you want to emphasise the action.

---

## Plain Language

- Use common words instead of formal or obscure ones
- Prefer short words where they carry the same meaning
- Explain technical terms on first use

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|--------|
| use | utilise |
| help | facilitate |
| about | with regard to |
| if | in the event that |
| before | prior to (when "before" works) |

---

## Contractions

Use everyday contractions so content sounds natural and approachable.

- we're, it's, don't, can't, you'll, that's
- Avoid overly formal "we have not", "do not" in body copy unless tone requires it (e.g. legal, formal notices)

---

## Verb Tenses

- Use **present** for general truth and instructions: "The dashboard shows recent activity."
- Use **past** for what happened: "The deployment completed successfully."
- Use **future** only when necessary: "You will receive a confirmation email."
- Avoid unnecessary perfect tenses when simple past or present is clearer.

---

## Conciseness

- Cut filler: "Please note that" → often delete; "at this time" → "now" or "currently"
- One main idea per sentence where possible
- Start with the most important information

---

## Addressing the Reader

- Speak to the reader as **"you"**
- Use **"we"** for Equal Experts when it's clear from context
- Keep "my" vs "your" consistent with the product (e.g. "your account" in product UI)
