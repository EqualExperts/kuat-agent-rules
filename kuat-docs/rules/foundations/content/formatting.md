# Formatting

How to use bold, capitalisation, headings, links, lists, and abbreviations in Equal Experts content.

---

## Quick Reference

- **Capitalisation:** Sentence case for headings, buttons, and body copy; title case only for proper nouns and product names
- **Bold:** Use sparingly for emphasis or key terms
- **Links:** Descriptive link text, not "click here" or raw URLs
- **Lists:** Use when items are parallel; keep items concise
- **Acronyms:** Spell out on first use, then use the short form

---

## Capitalisation

### Sentence case

Use sentence case for:
- Headings and subheadings
- Button and link labels
- List items
- Body copy

**Examples:**  
"Getting started"  
"Save and continue"  
"Contact the team"

### Title case

Reserve for:
- Proper nouns (Equal Experts, product names)
- Official titles when they are the full name of something

Do not use title case for general headings or UI labels.

---

## Bold and Italic

- **Bold:** Use for a small number of key terms or one-off emphasis. Don't bold whole sentences or paragraphs.
- *Italic:* Use for titles of works, technical terms on first use if needed, or subtle emphasis. Use sparingly in UI copy.

---

## Headings

- One H1 per page or screen (the main title)
- Use a logical hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3; don't skip levels
- Make headings descriptive so they work as a scan of the content
- Prefer sentence case

---

## Links

- Link text should describe the destination or action
- Avoid "click here", "read more", "learn more" without context

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|--------|
| Read the accessibility guidelines | Click here for guidelines |
| Pricing plans | Learn more |
| Contact the team | https://example.com/contact |

---

## Lists

- Use bullet lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for steps or ranked items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start with a lead-in sentence if it helps; don't repeat the same lead-in word in every item when not needed
- Prefer sentence case and consistent punctuation (full stops only if items are full sentences)

---

## Abbreviations and Acronyms

- Spell out on first use with the short form in parentheses: "Application Programming Interface (API)"
- Use the short form consistently after that
- For well-known terms in your audience (e.g. API, UX), first-use expansion is still helpful in public-facing or mixed-audience content
