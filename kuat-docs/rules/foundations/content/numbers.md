# Numbers

Guidance for dates, times, currency, and other numbers in Equal Experts content.

---

## Quick Reference

- **Dates:** Use a clear, unambiguous format; prefer written or ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) depending on context
- **Times:** Use 24-hour or am/pm consistently; specify time zone when relevant
- **Currency:** Use symbol or code (e.g. £, GBP) as appropriate; be consistent within a document
- **Percentages:** Use the % symbol with the number (e.g. 45%)
- **Large numbers:** Use commas (or spaces in some locales) for thousands

---

## Dates

- Prefer a format that avoids ambiguity (e.g. 24 March 2025 or 2025-03-24)
- In UK-facing content, day–month–year is standard (24 March 2025)
- In technical or international contexts, ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) is often clearer
- Spell out month names in body copy when space allows; abbreviate only in tables or tight UI (e.g. Mar 2025)

---

## Time

- Be consistent within a document: either 24-hour (14:30) or 12-hour with am/pm (2:30 pm)
- Specify time zone when the reader needs to act or compare across regions (e.g. "2:30 pm GMT")
- Use "noon" and "midnight" where they're clearer than 12:00

---

## Currency

- Use the appropriate symbol (£, $, €) or ISO code (GBP, USD, EUR) as fits the context
- Be consistent: don't mix "£10" and "10 GBP" in the same piece unless one is clearly a label
- For whole amounts, no decimal places unless it's pence/cents (e.g. £10 not £10.00 for ten pounds)

---

## Percentages

- Use the % symbol with the number: 45%, 12.5%
- In body copy, "45%" is usually preferable to "45 percent" unless you're writing for voice or very formal copy
- For a range, "40–60%" (en dash, no space)

---

## Units of Measure

- Use metric by default in UK/international content unless the audience or product uses imperial
- Abbreviate when standard: kg, m, km, cm. Spell out in prose when it reads more naturally
- Leave a space between number and unit: "5 kg", "12 cm"

---

## Large Numbers

- Use commas as thousand separators in English (1,000,000) or a thin space where that's the convention
- Keep formatting consistent in tables and lists
- For very large numbers, consider "1.5 million" or "2.3 billion" in body copy
