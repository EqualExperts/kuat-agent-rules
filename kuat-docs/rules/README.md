# Equal Experts Agent Rules

Design system rules and guidelines for AI agents and content creators.

## Loading index (canonical)

**Task → files and load order:** [LOADING.md](./LOADING.md)

The loading index is the single source of truth for:
- Which foundation rule files to load
- Which type-specific paths to load per task (slides, web_product, web_marketing, icons, etc.)
- Optional paths (scenarios, content subdirs, examples) and when to include them
