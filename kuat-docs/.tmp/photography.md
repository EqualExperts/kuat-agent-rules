# Photography & Imagery Rules

> Equal Experts photography style is **professional, people-focused and authentic**. These rules apply to all content and marketing materials: documents, presentations, websites, social media, videos, blogs, case studies, and print.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Authenticity first
All photography must feel genuine and relatable. Images should capture real moments of people at work, collaborating, or socialising — not posed or performative scenarios.

- **DO:** Use candid or near-candid shots that capture natural emotion and interaction
- **DO:** Show real work environments — desks, whiteboards, post-it notes, laptops in use
- **DON'T:** Use images of people posing directly at the camera with forced smiles
- **DON'T:** Use overly staged team scenarios (e.g. group high-fives, hands in a circle, hands cupping a plant)

### 1.2 People-focused
Images should centre human presence wherever possible. Prioritise photos that show people engaged in meaningful activity.

- **DO:** Show range of emotion — concentration, laughter, discussion, problem-solving
- **DO:** Feature people in context: at laptops, at whiteboards, in meetings, at events
- **DON'T:** Use imagery where people are incidental or decorative

### 1.3 Diversity and representation
Photography must represent a genuinely diverse range of people across all content. Diversity is not a secondary consideration — it is a core quality criterion. An image that is technically well-shot but fails to represent the breadth of the EE network and the world it works in does not meet our standard.

- **REQUIRED:** Feature people of different ages, genders, and ethnicities
- **REQUIRED:** Represent different roles — not just leadership or technical roles
- **DON'T:** Default to images that over-represent any single demographic
- **DON'T:** Use diversity as tokenism — a single non-white face in an otherwise homogeneous image does not satisfy this principle

See **Section 2** for full diversity and inclusion guidance.

## 2. Diversity & Inclusion in Photography

### 2.1 Why this matters
Equal Experts is a network of people from many backgrounds, cultures, disciplines, and life experiences. Our photography must reflect that reality. Images that default to narrow demographic assumptions — consciously or not — undermine trust with our audience and misrepresent who we are.

This section provides specific, checkable criteria. When reviewing or selecting any image featuring people, each criterion should be evaluated deliberately, not assumed.

### 2.2 Demographic representation

#### Age
- **DO:** Include people at different career stages — early career, mid-career, and senior practitioners
- **DO:** Show older practitioners as active contributors, not just in mentoring or management roles
- **DON'T:** Default to imagery that reads as a young workforce
- **DON'T:** Use imagery where older people are only shown in observational or passive roles

#### Gender
- **DO:** Show women and non-binary people in technical, leadership, and delivery roles — not just supporting or facilitation roles
- **DO:** Ensure gender representation is balanced across a collection of images, not just achieved in one
- **DON'T:** Default to male-presenting people for technical subjects (coding, architecture, engineering)
- **DON'T:** Default to female-presenting people for facilitation, administration, or soft-skills subjects

#### Ethnicity and cultural background
- **DO:** Actively seek images that represent people of different ethnic backgrounds
- **DO:** Ensure non-white people appear throughout content — not only in dedicated diversity moments
- **DON'T:** Use a single image of a person of colour to satisfy representation across a piece of content
- **DON'T:** Associate specific ethnicities with specific roles or seniority levels (e.g. only white people in leadership shots)

#### Disability and visible difference
- **DO:** Include images of people with visible disabilities where appropriate and available
- **DO:** Treat disability as a normal part of working life — not as a subject requiring special framing
- **DON'T:** Exclude or avoid people with visible disabilities when selecting images
- **DON'T:** Over-focus on disability as the defining element of an image unless that is the specific subject matter

### 2.3 Role and context representation

The roles and contexts in which people are shown carry meaning. Consistently showing the same type of person in the same type of role reinforces stereotypes, even when no single image is individually problematic.

| Context | ✅ Ensure variety includes | ❌ Avoid defaulting to |
|---|---|---|
| Technical work (coding, architecture) | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly young white or Asian men |
| Leadership / presenting | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly white men |
| Facilitation / workshops | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly women |
| Support / administrative | All genders and ethnicities | Predominantly women or junior-presenting people |
| Senior / experienced practitioners | Older people, all backgrounds | Only younger people |

### 2.4 Evaluating a set of images (not just individual images)

Diversity must be assessed at the level of the **full set of images** used in a piece of content or campaign — not image by image in isolation.

- **DO:** Review all images together before publishing to check overall representation
- **DO:** If a single image needs to show one person, consider how that person's characteristics interact with the rest of the content
- **DON'T:** Approve each image individually and ignore the cumulative effect
- **DON'T:** Use the same demographic profile repeatedly across a page or document just because each individual image technically passed review

**Example — passing individually, failing collectively:**
A case study page uses five images. Each image passes the individual quality check. But all five show white men working alone. This set fails the diversity standard even though no single image was flagged.

### 2.5 Authentic inclusion vs. performative diversity

There is a meaningful difference between authentic representation and performative diversity. EE photography should achieve the former.

**Authentic inclusion looks like:**
- A diverse group of people captured doing real work together, where diversity is incidental to the shot
- A senior practitioner of any background shown in a position of authority naturally
- Mixed groups in candid collaboration where the focus is the work, not the demographic mix

**Performative diversity looks like:**
- A carefully arranged group photo with one person of each demographic type, all smiling at camera
- A person of colour or woman placed visibly in the foreground of an otherwise homogeneous image
- Stock imagery where diversity feels like a deliberate product feature rather than a natural reality

- **DO:** Choose images where diverse people appear as a natural consequence of capturing real work
- **DON'T:** Select images where diversity appears to be the *purpose* of the image rather than a reflection of it

### 2.6 Diversity checklist for image selection

Use these checks for any image featuring people, in addition to the general validation checklist in Section 8.

- [ ] Does this image avoid reinforcing a demographic default for the role or activity shown?
- [ ] Are people of different ethnicities represented across the full content set?
- [ ] Are people of different ages represented across the full content set?
- [ ] Are women and non-binary people shown in technical and leadership contexts, not only in facilitation roles?
- [ ] Is the diversity in the image authentic and natural, rather than clearly staged for representation purposes?
- [ ] Viewed alongside all other images in this piece of content, does the set as a whole represent a realistic cross-section of people?
- [ ] If only one person is shown, does the choice of that person avoid reinforcing a stereotype about the role or activity?

## 3. Monochrome (Black & White) Treatment

All photography used in Equal Experts branded contexts must be rendered in **monochrome (black and white)** unless a specific exception applies.

### 2.1 When monochrome is required

| Context | Monochrome Required |
|---|---|
| Internal documents and reports | ✅ Yes |
| Internal presentations | ✅ Yes |
| External marketing and sales materials | ✅ Yes |
| Websites and internal sites | ✅ Yes |
| Social media | ✅ Yes |

### 2.2 Exceptions — colour is permitted

| Exception | Reason |
|---|---|
| Logos | Must remain in brand colour for recognition |
| Graphics and diagrams | Must follow the EE colour palette |
| Video content | See video brand guidelines |
| Brand collaborations | Follow agreed style with partner brand |

### 2.3 Applying monochrome in Google tools

**Google Docs:**
1. Insert image into the document
2. Select the image → click "Image Options" in the toolbar
3. Select "Recolor" in the Image Options panel
4. Choose "Grayscale" from the dropdown

**Google Slides:**
1. Insert image into the presentation
2. Select the image → click "Format Options" in the toolbar
3. Select "Recolor" in the Format Options panel
4. Choose "Grayscale" from the dropdown

## 4. Image Source Priority

Always follow this priority order when selecting imagery:

```
1. EE People Library (real network members, employees, consultants, alumni)
2. Approved EE Stock Library (pre-cleared images matching brand style)
3. New stock sourced via the Marketing team (with correct copyright clearance)
```

- **DO:** Use the EE People image library as the first stop for all people imagery
- **DO:** Use the approved stock library for industry, location, and technology concepts
- **DON'T:** Source and use stock images independently without marketing approval — copyright and brand fit must be verified
- **DON'T:** Use images from unapproved sources, personal libraries, or generic image searches

> If you cannot find a suitable image in either library, contact the marketing team via Slack **#ask-marketing**.

---

## 5. EE People Photography

Images featuring members of the Equal Experts Network take priority over all other imagery.

### 4.1 What qualifies as EE People imagery
- Current employees
- Active consultants
- Alumni who have provided consent

### 4.2 Acceptable subject matter
- People working individually (at laptops, writing, reviewing documents)
- Small group collaboration (whiteboard sessions, standups, pair working)
- Social and event contexts (conferences, off-sites, team gatherings)
- A mix of activities, emotions, and workplace interactions

### 4.3 Verification checklist for EE People imagery
- [ ] Image is sourced from the official EE People image library
- [ ] Subject(s) have provided consent (handled centrally by marketing)
- [ ] Image has been converted to monochrome (unless an exception applies)
- [ ] Image reflects authentic moment — not overly staged
- [ ] Diversity of representation is considered

---

## 6. Stock Photography

Use stock photography when EE people imagery doesn't cover the required use case — for example, to support an industry-specific message or illustrate a concept.

### 5.1 Approved stock use cases

| Use case | Example |
|---|---|
| **Industry context** | A retail transaction to illustrate a retail engagement |
| **Location** | A cityscape of Sydney for an Australia-based case study |
| **Technology in use** | A person using a laptop, tablet, or phone — showing realistic UI |
| **Technology concept** | A close-up of a microchip or circuit board — minimal, clean |
| **Abstract concepts** | A padlock and credit card to represent security or fraud |
| **Natural/work settings** | Hands sketching wireframes, someone taking notes |

### 5.2 Stock photography — approved characteristics

**Natural and genuine**
- People depicted in believable, unstaged scenarios
- Natural expressions and body language
- Environments that feel real — not polished or sterile

**Industry settings**
- Recognisable real-world activities (e.g. contactless payment, warehouse logistics)
- Settings that align with the content topic

**Accurate locations**
- Recent images — avoid images that look historically dated
- Clearly identifiable landmarks or cityscapes when location matters

**Technology in use**
- Realistic devices and software
- Genuine interaction (not posed "pretend typing")
- Screens showing plausible content — dashboards, code, data

**Abstract concepts as real objects**
- Use physical objects to represent concepts (e.g. padlock = security)
- Avoid digitally fabricated metaphors

### 5.3 Stock photography — prohibited content

| ❌ Prohibited | Why |
|---|---|
| Overly staged people shots | Feels fake — e.g. group high-fives, team huddles, posed "collaboration" |
| Heavily edited/unrealistic technology | Holograms, augmented reality overlays, fictional devices |
| Images reliant on colour or text for meaning | Won't work in monochrome — e.g. colourful AI concept art with floating text |
| Low-quality images | Blurry, distorted, or over-exposed — undermines brand credibility |
| AI-generated imagery | Not approved for use — authenticity and copyright are unverifiable |

---

## 7. Technical Quality Standards

All images used in EE content must meet these minimum quality standards:

- **Resolution:** High enough for intended output (web minimum 72dpi, print minimum 300dpi)
- **Sharpness:** No motion blur, camera shake, or focus errors on the primary subject
- **Exposure:** Correctly exposed — not over-exposed (blown highlights) or under-exposed (lost shadow detail)
- **Cropping:** Subject(s) appropriately framed — no awkward crops of heads, hands, or significant elements
- **Aspect ratio:** Match the intended layout — avoid stretching or squashing images

---

## 8. Accessibility Requirements

All images used in content must comply with accessibility standards.

- **REQUIRED:** Every non-decorative image must have descriptive alt text
- **REQUIRED:** Alt text should describe the content and context of the image, not just label it (e.g. "Two engineers reviewing code on a laptop in an open-plan office" not "photo of people")
- **REQUIRED:** Decorative images (purely visual, no informational value) should use `alt=""` to be skipped by screen readers
- **DON'T:** Rely solely on an image to convey critical information — always support with text

> See the EE Accessibility Best Practices guide for full guidance on writing alt text.
