# Intake (shared)

Ask intake in **one grouped message** before producing anything. Don't assume defaults the user hasn't given.

## Review depth (review skills)

Ask the user to choose — do **not** assume `brand_compliance` for "review this":

| Depth | Evaluates | Minimum context |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| `brand_compliance` | Tokens, logo, typography, spacing, accessibility | Artifacts only |
| `product_ux` | Task fit, copy, flows, empty/error states | Artifacts + product context |
| `full` | Brand + product UX + scenario/pattern rules | Above + research/insights |

If context for `product_ux`/`full` is missing, ask first; if the user proceeds anyway, mark UX findings **provisional** and list assumptions under **Open questions**. Never invent user stories or research conclusions.

## Universal intake

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 1 | Task / scenario (what is this, what is it for) |
| 2 | Audience and constraints (deadline, tech, policy, must-use patterns) |
| 3 | Artifacts (files, URLs, Figma, screenshots) — for review |
| 4 | Output format — for review, see [report-formats.md](./report-formats.md) |
| 5 | Deliverable format — for create (Figma, code, copy doc, deck file) |

If the deliverable or review depth is ambiguous, ask once before starting.
